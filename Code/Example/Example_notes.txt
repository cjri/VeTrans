The following commands describe an example application of the transmission inference code:

The directory initially contains a single file, Multi_locus_trajectories.out.  It may be valuable to look at the format of this file.

1.  Generate a haplotype reconstruction:

../VeTrans find_haplotypes --traj_in Multi_locus_trajectories.out --C 200

This should produce the following output to screen:

# of haplotypes = 1; BIC = 3391.02
# of haplotypes = 2; BIC = 1374.44
# of haplotypes = 3; BIC = 495.757
# of haplotypes = 4; BIC = 288.657
# of haplotypes = 5; BIC = 284.521
No significant BIC improvement: End calculation

A model of four haplotypes is favoured by the model; adding a fifth does not give a large improvement in BIC (a cutoff of a 10 unit improvement is required by the code).

The file Inferred_haplotypes.out is produced, describing the inferred haplotypes and their frequencies.  The code also produces files with names Inference_?_0.out, which describe the optimal solutions found for different numbers of haplotypes.


2.  Calculate the variance in the inference:

../VeTrans find_variance  --traj_in Multi_locus_trajectories.out --C 200 --haps_in Inferred_haplotypes.out

This calculates variance matrices for the inferred frequencies pre- and post-transmission.  The results are contained in the files Variances_pre.out and Variances_post.out.


3.  Estimate the transmission bottleneck with the explicit likelihood code

../VeTrans calc_bottleneck --haps_in Inferred_haplotypes.out --explicit 1 --max_n 20

This produces the output Likelihoods_exp.out.  The maximum likelihood in this case corresponds to the maximum likelihood bottleneck.  In our case a bottleneck of 5 was inferred by this method; the output of the file is below.   The option max_n is set to 20 as this method can be slow at higher transmission bottlenecks

16 -80.3924
17 -81.1104
18 -81.1637
19 -80.7134
20 -79.95

4.  Estimate the transmission bottleneck with the composite method

../VeTrans calc_bottleneck --haps_in Inferred_haplotypes.out 

This produces the output Likelihoods.out. In our case a bottleneck of 17 was inferred by this method, see below

The approximations underlying the composite method works better for higher bottlenecks; a good approach is to begin with the explicit likelihood calculation, then to use the composite approach if a maximum is not found using that method (e.g. if the bottleneck size appears to be high).  Our method produces likelihoods for bottlenecks up to size 1000; the calcuation is very fast even for high N^T.

Note that the absolute values of the likelihoods are not comparable.  This is due to the different approaches of the two methods.

Explicit:

Infer haplotype frequencies and their variances using the "before" and "after" data - Use the "before" sample with the "after" data to calculate a likelihood.

Composite:

Infer haplotype frequencies and their variances using the "before" and "after" data - Use the frequencies inferred for the "before" and "after" samples to calculate a likelihood.
